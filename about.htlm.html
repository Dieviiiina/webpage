            <p class="about-description">Dievina's essence is the result of years of breakout due to the myriad of chemicals put into the mainstram perfumes one can find in a supermarket or a beauty store. We are a resolution, that of not settling for a abrasive chemicals but giving our skins the respect it deserves by only using organic and safe formulas that are sensitive skin friendly to allow people who are want to enjoy perfuming themselves without having to worry about chemical x or y that is very corrosive for the skin and could damage their health.</p>
